# Relational Databases Projects @FreeCodeCamp

This repository (so far) contains three projects that is included in the FreeCodeCamp's [Relational Database](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) course including two projects required to obtain the certificate of the program:

1. Celestial Bodies Database (Certification Project)
2. Worldcup Database (Certification Project)
3. Bike Rental Shop (Tutorial Project)
4. Salon Appointment Scheduler (Certification Project)
5. Periodic Table Database (Certification Project)
6. Number Guessing Game (Certification Project)

## 1) Celestial Bodies Database

Contains the Celestial Bodies database for various planets within the solar system and beyond. It is generated by hard coding information found online using CLI of PostgreSQL.  

- universe.sql

which can be used to rebuild the Celestial Bodies database by entering `psql -U postgres < universe.sql` in a terminal where the .sql file is.

## 2) World Cup Database

Contains `worldcup.sql` dump file (generated via `pg_dump` CLI utility @ `psql`) for the Worldcup DB that have two tables `teams` (national teams that competed in the last 16 round and beyond in the WC 2014 and 2018) and `games` (each game in the last 16 round and beyond in the WC 2014 and 2018). 

The DB is populated by pipelining the contents of the `games.csv` file using the bash script `insert_data.sh`. The resulting DB is then queried using `queries.sh` to get more insight about the data.

Worldcup DB can be rebuild by entering `psql -U postgres < worldcup.sql` in a terminal where the .sql file is.

## 3) Bike Rental Shop

Contains:

- `bike-shop.sql` dump file that can be used to re-build the bikeshop database which include three tables `bikes` (list of bikes depending on their `type`, `size` and `availability`), `rentals` (the log of bike rentals with `rental_id`,`customer_id`,`bike_id`,`date_rented`, `date_returned`) and `customers` (with `customer_id`, `phone`, `name`) tables.
- A bash script `bike-shop.sh` that both interacts with the bike shop database and the user to mimic the bike rental and return process.

## 4) Salon Appointment Scheduler

Contains:

- `salon.sql` dump file that can be used to re-build the salon database which include three tables `services` (list of services offered by the salon shop with their `name`,`type` and `service_id`), `customers` (table with information on the customers of the salon including their UNIQUE `phone` number, `name` and `customer_id`) and `appointments` which keep track of the appointment schedule by keeping the log of `appointment_id`, `customer_id` , `service_id` and `time`.
- A bash script `salon.sh` that interacts with the salon database and the user to make appointments for services offered in the salon shop.

*Further possible improvements: Adding a module to make rescheduling of already existing appointments*

## 5) Periodic Table Database 

Contains:

- `periodic_table.sql` dump file that can be used to re-build the periodic table database which include three tables `elements` (list of some elements with their `atomic_number`, `name` and `symbol`), `properties` (table with information on the elements including their `atomic_number`, `atomic_mass`, `melting_point_celsius`, `boiling_point_celsius`, `type_id` which will be used to relate to the `types` table) and `types` table accounting for all possible types  (metallic,nonmetallic,metalloid) of an element with a corresponding `type_id`.
  
- A bash script `element.sh` that interacts with the database to return information about an element provided that `name`,`symbol` or `atomic_number` of the element is provided as an argument.

  *Further possible improvements: Add more interesting elements/properties to make a more complete periodic table database*

## 6) Number Guessing Game

- `number_guess.sql` dump file that can be used to re-build the database required to interact with the `number_guess.sh`. The DB include two tables `users` (list of users that logs to the game with a `username` assigned with a `user_id`) and `games` (table with information about past games played by users) including `game_id`, `user_id`, `n_of_guesses` to indicate the number of guesses the corresponding user made before guessing the correct random number generated by the `number_guess.sh` bash script.
  
- A bash script `number_guess.sh` that interacts with the database and the users to store information about new users/existing users and play the number guessing name in an iterative manner.
