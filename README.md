# Relational Databases Projects @FreeCodeCamp

This repository contains .sql dump files and bash scripts to automatically pipeline the contents of .csv files to a certain database

## Celestial Bodies Database

Contains the Celestial Bodies database for various planets within the solar system and beyond. It is generated by hard coding information found online using CLI of PostgreSQL.  

- universe.sql

which can be used to rebuild the Celestial Bodies database by entering `psql -U postgres < universe.sql` in a terminal where the .sql file is.

## World Cup Database

Contains `worldcup.sql` dump file (generated via `pg_dump` CLI utility @ `psql`) for the Worldcup DB that have two tables `teams` (national teams that competed in the last 16 round and beyond in the WC 2014 and 2018) and `games` (each game in the last 16 round and beyond in the WC 2014 and 2018). 

The DB is populated by pipelining the contents of the `games.csv` file using the bash script `insert_data.sh`. The resulting DB is then queried using `queries.sh` to get more insight about the data.

Worldcup DB can be rebuild by entering `psql -U postgres < worldcup.sql` in a terminal where the .sql file is.
